##Docker Installation in VM##
yum install Docker.io --> Linux
apt-get install Docker.io --> ubuntu
docker info --> to check versin and operating system

##Docker Pull or run Images##

when pull the image it will check in docker host (where install the docker) , when docker install internally Docker daemon component available .in that daemon it check that image .
  in case image is not avaiable  in docker host then only it download from registry. 

Docker pull imagename --> it will download the image from docker registry if it not present in local
Docker  images --> to chceck the docker images.

##Unique id##
image,voulume, container will have unique id's.
they have specfic uniquie ids.

##List of ports##
netstat  -- > to check the listenof ports running.


##How to Create the Image to container##
will create by using imageid/imagename:tag 

-it (intreactice mode)-->the application will start but we cont do anything in our vm
-d (detached mode) --> the applicatin will start and we can use in pur vm.

from one image will create number of container. but port will different if port port farwording and container name also if providing conatiner.


docker run -it -p hostport:containerport imageid:tag/imageid --> it will downaload image the image (if not present) and it will create the container 
docker run -it    -p    81:80
docker run -d -p hostport:containerport image --> it will downaload image the image (if not present) and it will create the container 
docker run -d   -p    81:80

##same image number of container creation##

docker run -d -p 81:80 --name test1 niginx
docker run -d -p 81:80 --name test2 niginx

##Login in container##
dpcker exec -it containerid/containername bash/sh/ --> login into the container
docker exec -it test1 bash




##Docker inspect##
inspect means will get the details information
if provide the name if not it take randaomally.

docker inspect containername/contanerid --> to inspect the container details.
doeckrt inspect imageid/imagename:tafg --> to inspect the image details.

##Container network##

by using network drivers ip will assign to containers.
when docker install by default network drives --> host, bridge, null.


 container ip and instance ip are different bcoz --> it take will take from bridge n/w 
 
 note - by default docker container are launch under brige n/w , bridge n/w has one default subnet.
 
 docker inspect bride --> to inspect the bridge
 
 ##Docker Delete images and containers##
docker ps --> to check all the running container.
docaker ps -a --> to check all list of containers.
docker rm -f --> delete the container (containerid or containername)
docker rmi -f --> delete the imagae (imageid/imaagename:tag)
  
  2ways to delete the containers
       docker rm -f conainername1 containernam2 --> it will delete the containers
       docker rm -f $(docker ps) --> it will delete the all running contianer at a time
       docker rm -f $(docker images) --> it will delete the all images at a time
